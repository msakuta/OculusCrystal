=============

Crystal System Visualization Test Project for Oculus Rift


Overview
--------

This project is forked from OculusRoomTiny sample in Oculus SDK 0.4.0.
It does not include all the files in the SDK.
Place the working tree under Samples directory of the SDK.


Build
-----

It's confirmed to build with Visual Studio 2013.
It uses a tiny amount of C++11 features, so older versions of Visual Studio
or other compilers may fail to build.

Also, I have only tested the program with DirectX11.  I'm not sure if the
program runs with OpenGL.  I have not tested Linux or Mac OS either.
